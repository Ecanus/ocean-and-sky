### **Key Mechanics**

*Character Mechanics*
* PlayerCharacter Collisions
* Camera zoom on PlayerCharacter proximity
* Rhythm-based movement speed multiplier

*Diving/Jumping*
* PlayerCharacter 1 - Sky, can dive into lower half of screen space for a period of time. Gains temporary movement speed boost. PlayerCharacter 2 - Ocean, can jump into upper half of screen space for a period of time. Gains temporary movement speed boost.

*MixUps*
* Sound and Colours represented vividly throughout game. Players are to synchornise their actions with one another, and with the music.
* Characters should coordinate their actions in order to perform combos.

### **Systems**
*Day/Night Cycle*
* Time transitions. At a modified game rate. Daytime emphasises beauty of the sky domain. With higher frequency of aerial fauna. Nighttime emphasies beauty of the ocean domain. With higher frequency of marine fauna.
* One more system interaction! Perhaps weather?

*Fauna/Flora*
* To enhance scenery of stage, as well as to provide additional challenges to PlayerCharacters.

### **A.I.**
*Fauna/Flora*
* Creatures equipped with mannerisms to adapt and interact with PlayerCharacters even without direct input from Players.
